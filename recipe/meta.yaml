  summary: The C++ Standard Library for Parallelism and Concurrency
  description: |
    HPX is a C++ Standard Library for Concurrency and Parallelism. It implements all of the
    corresponding facilities as defined by the C++ Standard. Additionally, in HPX we implement
    functionalities proposed as part of the ongoing C++ standardization process. We also extend
    the C++ Standard APIs to the distributed case.
